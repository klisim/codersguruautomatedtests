Feature: Find mentor as logged user

  Scenario: Log in and provide wrong payment options
    Given I open login coder guru website
    When I log in as "45ddgdgss@mail.com" user with password "Mojehaslo"
    And I pick from the dropdown "GIT" and click find mentor
    And I pick mentor 1 on the list
    And I enter problem description as "Nie umiem w gita"
    And I pick first possible date and time and go to payment
    And I pick credit card payment
    And provide CC data as "1234 5677 8899 9999 212" "12/2020" "123" "Jan Kowalski" "ziomziom@rapsy.pl" and click pay
